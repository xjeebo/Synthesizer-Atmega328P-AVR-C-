# Synthesizer-Atmega328P-AVR-C-
## My final project from one of my computer engineering courses at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV).

# Intro
## Demonstrate sound capabilities of the atmega328P and manipulate its pitch. The 328Pâ€™s internal set of timers play a big role with a technique called pulse width modulation (PWM). With PWM, we are able to produce sounds off a speaker using voltage, which produces a square wave signal, and by adjusting the frequency within the 328p.
